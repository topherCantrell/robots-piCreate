# Back and Forth Badge

Basic robot tasks can be frustrating! Try this simple challenge:
  - Drive the robot forward several seconds
  - Turn the robot around
  - Drive back to the starting point

Did the robot make it back to its starting point? How can you measure the difference and assign an error value?

How did you determine how long to turn the robot? Does the straight-time affect the final error? Does the driving
surface affect the times and error?
